Cleanup: 
- [ ] Consider the sensor object, do we need it or could it just be a gameobject. 


Features:

- [ ] Put in a sprite renderer for person
- [ ] Create evolving tree 
- [ ] Add money coin animation by collosion

- [ ] Design Economy balance, i.e red knob needs to cool. i.e. But arousal only 
possible warm
- [ ] Make it monochrome
